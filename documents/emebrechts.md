# Summary Reading Emembrechts

## Introduction

- dependency properties and pitfalls
- intro to linear dependency
- intro to copulas
- intro to spherical distribution
- intro to comonotoncity
- intro to rank correlation
- intro to tail dependence

## Fallacies

- Fallacy 1. Marginal distributions and correlation determine the joint distribution.
- Fallacy 2. Given marginal distributions F1 and F2 for X and Y , all linear correlations b etween -1 and 1 can b e attained through suitable specification of the joint distribution.
- Fallacy 3. The worst case VaR (quantile) for a linear portfolio X + Y o ccurs when (X; Y ) is maximal, i.e. X and Y are comonotonic

## Simulation of Random Vectors

- Theorem 6 is interesting
- More properties of comonotonicty
- Copula case we covered in class
