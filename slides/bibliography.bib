  abstract = {In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, there has been criticism of mathematics and the mathematical models used by the finance industry. We answer these criticisms through a discussion of some of the actuarial models used in the pricing of credit derivatives. As an example, we focus in particular on the Gaussian copula model and its drawbacks. To put this discussion into its proper context, we give a synopsis of the financial crisis and a brief introduction to some of the common credit derivatives and highlight the difficulties in valuing some of them.},

  abstract = {This article introduces actuaries to the concept of copulas, a tool for understanding relationships among multivariate outcomes. A copula is a function that links univariate marginals to their full multivariate distribution. Copulas were introduced in 1959 in the context of probabilistic metric spaces. The literature on the statistical properties and applications of copulas has been developing rapidly in recent years. This article explores some of these practical applications, including estimation of joint life mortality and multidecrement models. In addition, we describe basic properties of copulas, their relationships to measures of dependence, and several families of copulas that have appeared in the literature. An annotated bibliography provides a resource for researchers and practitioners who wish to continue their study of copulas. For those who wish to use copulas for statistical inference, we illustrate statistical inference procedures by using insurance company data on losses and expenses. For these data, we (1) show how to ﬁt copulas and (2) describe their usefulness by pricing a reinsurance contract and estimating expenses for pre-speciﬁed losses.},

  abstract   = {Modern risk management calls for an understanding of stochastic dependence going beyond simple linear correlation. This paper deals with the static (non-time-dependent) case and emphasizes the copula representation of dependence for a random vector. Linear correlation is a natural dependence measure for multivariate normally and, more generally, elliptically distributed risks but other dependence concepts like comonotonicity and rank correlation should also be understood by the risk management practitioner. Using counterexamples the falsity of some commonly held views on correlation is demonstrated; in general, these fallacies arise from the naive assumption that dependence properties of the elliptical world also hold in the non-elliptical world. In particular, the problem of ﬁnding multivariate models which are consistent with prespeciﬁed marginal distributions and correlations is addressed. Pitfalls are highlighted and simulation algorithms avoiding these problems are constructed.},
