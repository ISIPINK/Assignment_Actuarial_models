\title{The use/abuse of copulas in actuarial science and finance}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This is an assignment for the actuarial models course.
    The assignment is to summarize \cite{dempster_correlation_2002},
    \cite{donnelly_devil_nodate} and \cite{frees_understanding_1998}  and discuss the following:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item  The purpose is to understand the impact of the assumption regarding
              the dependence structure between risk factors.
        \item  This is done by means of the concept of copulas.
        \item  In particular, we study the impact of misused copulas and correlation in the
              valuation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOâ€™s).
    \end{itemize}

\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}
\cite{dempster_correlation_2002} introduces linear dependency, copulas, comonotonicity and rank correlation which
already are introduced in the course. Also spherical/elliptical distributions and tail dependence are introduced.
Spherical/elliptical distributions generalize the normal distribution and has good properties for common dependency
measures.  Tail dependence quantifies dependency in the tails. \cite{dempster_correlation_2002} discusses some
common dependency fallacies. It also covers simulation of copulas what we also covered in the course.   \\
