I'll provide feedback on the given text, focusing on grammar, clarity, coherence, accuracy, completeness, style, and relevance.

**Grammar and Spelling:**
The text appears to be free of major grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. However, there are a few minor issues:

- In the abstract, the sentence "This is an assignment for the actuarial models course." is a statement, not a question. Consider rephrasing it to make it a statement.
- In the section "Introduction to new concepts," the sentence "Here are some obvious properties of elliptical distributions:" is not grammatically correct. Consider rephrasing it to "Here are some obvious properties of elliptical distributions:"

**Clarity and Coherence:**
The text is generally clear and coherent, but there are a few areas where the writing could be improved:

- In the section "Introduction to new concepts," the transition between the discussion of spherical/elliptical distributions and tail dependence could be smoother.
- The section "CDO's" jumps abruptly from discussing the concept of CDOs to highlighting the role of inadequate modeling in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Consider adding a transition sentence to connect the two ideas.

**Accuracy and Completeness:**
The text appears to be accurate and complete in its coverage of the topics. However, there are a few areas where additional information could be added:

- The section on tail dependence could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the concept and its importance in finance.
- The section on CDO's could include more information on the role of CDOs in the financial crisis and how they are used in practice.

**Style and Tone:**
The text is written in a formal and professional tone, which is suitable for an academic assignment. However, the writing could be more engaging and concise:

- Consider breaking up long paragraphs into shorter ones to improve readability.
- Use more active and descriptive verbs to make the text more engaging.

**Relevance and Relevance:**
The text is relevant to the assignment and covers the required topics. However, there are a few areas where the relevance could be improved:

- The section on "Possible applications" could include more information on how copulas are used in practice and their relevance to the financial industry.
- The section on "Link with lecture's topics" could include more specific examples of how the concepts discussed in the text relate to the course material.

Overall, the text is well-written and covers the required topics. With some revisions to address the areas mentioned above, it could be even stronger.
