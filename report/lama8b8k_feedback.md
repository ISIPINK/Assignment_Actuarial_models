There are no major grammatical errors, but some minor issues:
In the abstract, the sentence "The assignment is to summarize \cite{dempster_correlation_2002}, \cite{frees_understanding_1998}, \cite{donnelly_devil_nodate} and discuss the following:" is a bit unclear. Consider rephrasing it to make it more concise.
In the section on spherical/elliptical distributions, the sentence "An affine transformation of an elliptical distribution is also elliptical." could be rephrased for better clarity.
There are a few instances of inconsistent verb tenses (e.g., "is" vs. "are") throughout the text. Ensure consistency in verb tense usage.

The introduction to new concepts section could be more concise and focused on the main ideas.
